This project is about showing the national parks around the world with descriptions, pictures, services, possible activities and so on.<br />
The pictures are stored in Cloudinary and the data are stored in MongoDB Atlas.
Visitors can search for parks according to different conditions, such as continent, country, attractions, activities, or trail difficulty.<br />
Logged in users can write feedback and rate the parks (or edit and delete their ratings).
Only admin user can add new parks to the database or edit, delete the existing ones (test admin username: TestAdmin, password: testAdmin2023 if you want to test this functionality).
